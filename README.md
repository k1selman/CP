# Competitive programming / Problem solving
Basically, here I will upload my solutions to problems from various competitive programming websites.

**Goal:** Practice problem solving.

In order to run any of the code from this repository you will have to:

**1.** Compile the source code

**2.** Run the executable file (naturally, output may look weird because these are solutions to cp problems)
